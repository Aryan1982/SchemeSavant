The methodology of Project making: 
Scheme-Savant is a web-based platform that helps farmers in India to identify government schemes that they are eligible for based on their personal and financial details. The project is implemented using ReactJs for the front-end, and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the back-end. The system architecture consists of a front-end component for user input, a back-end component for data processing and validation, and a database for storing and retrieving information. The database schema is designed to support efficient querying and indexing of user data. The algorithm used to match user input with eligible schemes is designed to be both accurate and efficient. The user interface is designed to be simple, intuitive, and accessible to farmers with minimal technology experience. The project follows a standard software development lifecycle approach, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

Application of proposed project in a societal context: 
Scheme-Savant has the potential to make a significant impact on the lives of farmers in India. By providing farmers with an easy-to-use platform for identifying eligible government schemes, the project can help to address the issue of low awareness and utilization of such schemes. This, in turn, can help to reduce financial stress on farmers, increase their income, and improve their standard of living. By promoting greater utilization of government schemes, Scheme-Savant can also contribute to the government's efforts to support farmers and boost the agricultural sector.
